# Unified Cybersecurity Framework

This project is a comprehensive, modular cybersecurity framework that integrates multiple advanced technologies for offensive and defensive operations. It is designed for research, simulation, and educational purposes to explore the convergence of AI, quantum computing, blockchain, and other cutting-edge fields in cybersecurity.

## Project Structure

The framework is organized into the following modules:

- `ai_modules/`: Contains AI-powered tools for reconnaissance, exploit generation, and phishing.
- `autonomous_agents/`: Implements a framework for autonomous agents capable of decision-making and coordinated actions.
- `blockchain_c2/`: Provides a decentralized command and control infrastructure using blockchain technology.
- `deepfake_social/`: A platform for creating and deploying deepfake content for social engineering campaigns.
- `neural_payloads/`: Generates evasive payloads using neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.
- `quantum_crypto/`: Implements quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms for secure communication.
- `zero_day_arsenal/`: A framework for discovering, analyzing, and weaponizing zero-day vulnerabilities.
- `main.py`: The master integration script that coordinates all modules.

## Core Modules

### 1. AI Modules (`ai_modules`)
- **ReconNet-v4.0**: An autonomous reconnaissance system that uses AI to discover and analyze targets.
- **ExploitGPT**: A generative AI model for creating exploits based on vulnerability data.
- **GhostNet**: A stealthy network communication protocol that mimics normal traffic patterns.
- **DeepFake-Phisher**: An AI-powered tool for generating highly convincing phishing content.

### 2. Quantum Cryptography (`quantum_crypto`)
- Implements CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures, providing protection against quantum attacks.
- Includes a DNA steganography module for ultra-secure data hiding.

### 3. Blockchain C2 (`blockchain_c2`)
- A decentralized command and control system built on Ethereum Layer 2.
- Uses smart contracts for command dispatch, data exfiltration, and payment processing.
- Integrates IPFS for distributed data storage and privacy coins for anonymous transactions.

### 4. Neural Payloads (`neural_payloads`)
- Generates highly evasive and polymorphic payloads using a combination of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.
- Employs advanced obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.

### 5. DeepFake Social Engineering (`deepfake_social`)
- A complete platform for creating and executing social engineering campaigns.
- Features real-time voice cloning, AI-powered video generation, synthetic social media profile creation, and a psychological manipulation engine.

### 6. Autonomous Agents (`autonomous_agents`)
- A framework for deploying swarms of autonomous agents that can perform complex missions.
- Includes a sophisticated decision-making engine based on reinforcement learning, a multi-vector attack coordinator, and swarm intelligence capabilities.

### 7. Zero-Day Arsenal (`zero_day_arsenal`)
- An end-to-end framework for the discovery and weaponization of zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Automates fuzzing, crash analysis, PoC generation, and exploit weaponization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pip` for package management

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/unified-cybersecurity-framework.git
   cd unified-cybersecurity-framework
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Framework
To run a full, coordinated attack chain demonstration, execute the main integration script:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will initialize all modules, run a simulated attack scenario, and generate a report.

## Usage
Each module can be run independently for specific tasks. Refer to the source code in each module's directory for detailed usage examples.

- **AI Reconnaissance**: `python ai_modules/reconnet_v4.py`
- **Quantum Cryptography**: `python quantum_crypto/quantum_resistant_crypto.py`
- **And so on for each module...**
